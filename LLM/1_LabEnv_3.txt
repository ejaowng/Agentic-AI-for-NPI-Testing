First we define the ontology: we have a Chamber class, an MB vDU class (named mb_vdu), an MSRBS class, and their associated classes. Each MB vDU is linked to an MB DUFunction (named mb_du_func), which in turn has a list of MB DU cells (named mb_du_cell), connected through the relations hasMBDUFunc and hasMBDUCell. Similarly, each MSRBS is linked to an LBDUFunction (named msrbs_lb_du_func), which has a list of LB DU cells (named lb_du_cell), connected through the relations hasLBDUFunc and hasLBDUCell. A Chamber has a collection of remote desktops (named rdt), connected by the hasRDTs relation. We also have a Test class (named test). Each cell/remote desktop can only be assigned to one test at a time, represented by the assignedTo relation. This information is for reference only and will be used later in the final query step so no action now. 

Second, we describe the lab: our lab consists of chamber 10B. In chamber 10B, there are two MB vDUs (DL10 and DL04) and one MSRBS (1170). DL10 hosts one MB DUFunction with six MB DU cells: DL10DUCell1 through DL10DUCell6. DL04 has a similar setup, with MB DU cells named DL04DUCell1 through DL04DUCell6. MSRBS1170 hosts one DUFunction with two LB DU cells: MSRBS1170LBDUCell1 and MSRBS1170LBDUCell2 and two LTE cells: MSRBS1170LTECell1 and MSRBS1170LTECell2, chamber 10B has one remote desktop, rdt105. Currently, no cells in chamber 10B are assigned to any test. This information is for reference only and will be used later in the final query step so no action now.

Third, we describe the query requirements: include the code necessary to execute the generated rules at the end. Please keep the ontology and rules simple. Use lowercase for class names, instance names should be enclosed in single quotes. Do not add extra comments. At the end, please include the directive (not the rule) to run the code directly on a prolog tool. Follow the exact instructions above and use the exact class names and relations provided. This information is for reference only and will be used later in the final query step so no action now.

Last, we describe the query, which is based on the three descriptions provided above. Generate the chamber ontology and its instances based on the description above, formatted in SWI-Prolog. Allow discontiguous definitions. Use dynamic predicates (for example, mb_du_cell('mbducell1')) instead of defining class, object, and relation with terms like object('mb_du_cell', class), etc. After generating the ontology and instances, create a SWI-Prolog rule using the built-in predicate createObjects (with name and classType as inputs) to generate objects for the Chamber, MB vDUs, MSRBSs, cells, and remote desktops. After running this rule, call the built-in configChamberCells predicate with no inputs. Then define a rule for selecting a chamber to be used for the SA IPCA test (IPCA is an instance of test, and the instance name should be enclosed in single quotes). Select MB cell 'DL10DUCell1', LB cell 'MSRBS1170LBDUCell1' and remote desktop 'rdt105', the selected cells and remote desktop must be assigned to the IPCA test using assert. After these steps, the chamber and cells assigned to the IPCA test should be labeled: the assigned MB cell as 'MB cell 1', the assigned LB cell as 'LB cell 1'. Use the external built-in labelCells predicate, which takes three inputs: name, label, and test. Do not include any markdown code fences or formatting (such as prolog or ). The code should appear as plain text only.
