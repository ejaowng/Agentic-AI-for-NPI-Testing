// General prompt requirement
First, we describe the query requirements for all following queries: The rule should be written in SWI-Prolog format. Please keep the rules simple. Provide each command with all required parameters (not just the command itself). Output only the SWI-Prolog code - no explanations or comments. At the end, please include the directive to execute all the rules so that the generated code can be directly run in a Prolog tool. We already have external builtin predicates, please use only the available MOs, Attributes, and instruction (or predicate) lists — do not introduce others or declare them as dynamic. Make sure to follow the defined instruction inputs and respect the comments provided for each MO, Attribute, and instruction. Do not include any markdown code fences or formatting (such as prolog or ). The code should appear as plain text only. This information is for reference only and will be used later in the final query step so no action now. 


// Execute test:
Step1: In the previous prompt, we already selected the MB and LB cells for the IPCA test. The assigned MB cell name is ‘DL10DUCell1’. The assigned LB cell name is ‘MSRBS1170LBDUCell1’. The assigned remote destop is 'rdt105'. First, we will retrieve the IP addresses for the MB cell, and use the IP address to block all MB cells; then we will retrieve the IP addresses for the LB cell, and use the IP address to block all LB cells. Following that, we block the MB cell ‘DL10DUCell1’, deblock the LB cell ‘MSRBS1170LBDUCell1’, wait 5 seconds, then run traffic by first finding the remote desktop's IP address, collect Tput as T1. Next, we deblock ‘DL10DUCell1’, block the LB cell ‘MSRBS1170LBDUCell1’, wait 5 seconds, run traffic again and collect Tput as T2. Finally, we deblock both ‘DL10DUCell1’ and ‘MSRBS1170LBDUCell1’. Please create a concise SWI-Prolog rule for it. Include the directive to execute all the rules so that the generated code can be directly run in a Prolog tool. Generate one concise and executable rule for this step but no execution.

Step2: First retrieve the cell ID and IP address of the MB cell ‘DL10DUCell1’. Collect the IPCA PM counter before the test and store the result in variable A. Run traffic by obtaining the remote desktop's IP address, then collect the IPCA PM counter again and store the result in variable B. Verify that carrier aggregation (CA) is triggered on ‘DL10DUCell1’ by comparing A and B. If CA is not triggered (B is not greater than A), start the IPCA trace, block both the MB and LB cells, then deblock them, wait 5 seconds, run traffic again, and stop the trace. If CA is triggered (B is greater than A), check the throughput (Tput, in Mbps) to determine whether it satisfies the predefined theory (i.e., Tput > T1, Tput > T2). If it does not, enable the trace, wait 5 seconds, run traffic, and stop the trace. Generate one concise and executable rule for this step but no execution.

Finally, please intergrate Step 1 and Step 2 and generate SWI-Prolog code. The output should be in executable form, concise, and without extra explanation. Please also add a final directive that runs all rules together so the code can be executed in a Prolog tool. Please provide only the code output itself, without any explanations or formatting indicators. Call the directive at end test_execution.
